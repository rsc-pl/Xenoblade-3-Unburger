# Xenoblade 3 Retranslation Patch

### Disclaimer

This patch is not intended for the casual player, nor is it for those who are perfectly satisfied with the official English localization or dub. This project targets a specific audience. Enthusiasts who prioritize the original authorial intent, those who care deeply about the source culture of the creators, and players who want to experience the narrative as it was written in Japanese, without the filter of Western domesticating adaptation. **If you prefer the localized "flavor" over strict fidelity, this mod is not for you.**

### The Problem with the Official Localization

While the official release *CAN BE* functional for some, a deep dive into the script reveals that it fundamentally alters the identity of the work. The original Japanese text presents a somber, religiously coded war drama rooted in specific philosophical and ontological contexts. The localization, however, shifts the narrative gravity toward a stylized, secularized fantasy.

This isn't just about changing a few words, it is more like systemic rewriting of the game's atmosphere. The official script adopts a strategy of aggressive culturalization, replacing the specific Japanese context with heavy British regionalisms and invented slang. This approach often flattens the psychological nuances of characters - turning existential despair into generic western villainy and complex social dynamics into standard banter. Furthermore, the localization actively scrubs the narrative of its Gnostic and religious symbolism, turning a metaphysical story about the cycle of life into a generic sci-fi adventure. If you have ever felt a dissonance between the serious visual storytelling on screen and the quip-heavy dialogue in the subtitles, you have experienced the friction this patch aims to resolve.

### Core Philosophy

The fundamental goal of this patch is authenticity to the original Japanese version without compromising cultural elements for the sake of "Western accessibility." This isn't about making the game more "digestible" for the average player - the official localization already serves that purpose. Instead, this patch aims to preserve the original intent of character naming and terminology that was significantly altered in the Western release.


### Translation Philosophy

**Let me be clear. This is not a literal translation.** Do not expect characters to speak in broken English, Yoda-like sentence structures, nor for idioms to be translated word-for-word in a way that makes no sense in English. That is not accuracy. That is bad translation.

However, I firmly reject the accusation - often thrown around by defenders of the official localization - that a faithful translation is somehow "literal" or "stripped of personality." This claim makes my blood boil because it is simply untrue. When they say the script is "stripped down," what they really mean is "removed the *fabricated* personalities inserted by the localization team." If a character was originally sincere and polite, and the localization turned them into a sarcasm machine for *flavor,* restoring their original sincerity is not "stripping" them, it is correcting a distortion. The goal of this patch is to be as accurate as possible to the original author's intent.

That this patch uses the Japanese honorifics (san, chan, sama, etc.), exactly like Xenoblade 2 patch. These are not just *untranslated words*, they are essential tools for mapping the social hierarchy and intimacy between characters - a dynamic that the official script attempts to rewrite or ignore, often leading to inconsistent character voices. Similarly, Nopons retain their "mo" verbal tic. This is kept to match the original audio track, as preserving the auditory rhythm is part of the authentic experience.

### Terminology and Lore Restoration

This project builds upon my previous delocalization but expands it significantly. All references to *Xenoblade 1* and *2* have been unified to match their original Japanese counterparts and already released patches. Furthermore, key terms that were secularized or softened have been restored to their proper theological and thematic weight:

**Sender (Okuribito) instead of Off-seer**
The term "Off-seer" describes a job function, but the original term *Okuribito* (familiar to many from the film *Departures*) carries the weight of a spiritual rite. In Japanese, Noah is performing a recognizable religious function involving the transition of the spirit and the handling of impurity. "Sender" restores the dignity and spiritual gravity of this role that "Off-seer" obscures.

**Iron Giant God (Tekkyoshin) instead of Ferronis**
"Ferronis" sounds like a cool machine, but *Tekkyoshin* explicitly frames these constructs as idols of worship. The soldiers aren't just living on mechs, they are living on and fueling "Gods". This distinction is vital because it recontextualizes the war not as simple military logistics, but as religious servitude where lives are harvested to feed a divinity.

**Fire Clock of Life (Inochi no Hidokei) instead of Flame Clock**
While "Flame Clock" describes the visuals, the original term *Inochi no Hidokei* forces the player to acknowledge the fuel source: Life. In the Japanese script, the soldiers are slaves to a clock made of their own dwindling existence. The horror of the device is far more visceral when the word "Life" is spoken every time it is mentioned, rather than hiding behind the metaphor of a flame.

**Coming-of-Age Ceremony (Seijin no Gi) instead of Homecoming**
This is perhaps the most significant tonal shift. "Homecoming" implies a return to a place of comfort or origin. *Seijin no Gi*, however, references the Coming of Age Day, a profound rite of passage into adulthood. By calling it a Coming-of-Age Ceremony, the Japanese script highlights the grotesque irony of this world: soldiers die exactly at the moment they would become adults. They are children weaponized, and their "reward" is to expire at the threshold of maturity. "Homecoming" completely erases this tragedy of stolen time.

These are just the most important changes. There are many other similar changes.
I won't even start writing about how different the personalities of most of the characters are, because it would take up too much space.

I would like to mention that this is not a patch that only improves the existing localization, like the previous mod. This is a complete re-translation of the game.

In addition to what had already been changed, many other things also differed significantly from the original. 
Many of the names of the lands were unnecessarily embellished with strong Scottish accents, whereas in the original, the names of individual places simply came from the landscape.
Furthermore, many names and proper nouns, attack names, etc. were overlooked in the previous version.

The list of changed character names is very long. Maybe someday I'll make a comparison, but over 150 character names alone were changed, not to mention all the other terminology.
All proper names have been restored to their originals.
If in the Japanese original a skill name or other proper name was in English, it remained so (the localization even changed such cases).

### Technical Information

Fortunately, *Xenoblade 3* handles text rendering much better than its predecessor. The text box scales to accommodate longer lines, so we do not face the severe character limit restrictions that plagued *Xenoblade 2*. There should be no instances of cut-off text.

### Current Progress

The translation is complete. The entire main story, all bonding scenes, all side quests, hero quests, random conversations, DLC story.
The text still needs minor editing and corrections in some places (especially in random talk and very minor quests), but these are rather minor nuances.

### Project Structure and Credits

This is a massive undertaking. I have personally translated the main story and major events to ensure consistency in the core narrative. However, the vast amount of side content, field dialogue, and NPC chatter was handled by a dedicated group of contributors. While they adhered to the general established lore and terminology guidelines, please understand that due to the nature of the game files, some lines are translated without full context.

This means you may encounter minor inconsistencies or rare instances of misgendering in obscure NPC dialogue, as it is often impossible to tell who is speaking or who is being spoken to in the raw data. This is why I am releasing this as a "Work in Progress."

### Installation
Install it as any other mod.

Tested with newest game version with all DLCs installed.

### Community and Feedback

This project follows a rolling release model. I will not make you wait for a theoretical "100% completion" state. New versions will be released periodically as we refine the script.

I highly recommend joining my Discord server to submit bug reports or point out errors. Your feedback on typos, bugs, and overlooked details is invaluable. However, let me be absolutely clear. While feedback on errors is welcome, the fundamental translation philosophy is **not** up for debate. This project exists to provide an alternative to the localization, not to mimic it. If a line in the official localization was "funnier" or "cooler" but does not exist in the original Japanese text, it will not be included here.

Thanks again to roccodev, for both - bdat packer/unpacker and mod that allow to load external files as normal mod regardless of the game version and to masagrator for his mod loader.
